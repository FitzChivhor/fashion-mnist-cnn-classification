# Fashion Image Classification with CNNs on Fashion-MNIST

This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to accurately classify images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset into 10 distinct categories. The Fashion-MNIST dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images of fashion articles, with 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

## Main Objective

The main objective of this project is to achieve an accuracy above 90% on the test set by designing an appropriate CNN architecture and tuning its hyperparameters. This classification model could be useful for various applications in the fashion industry, such as automated tagging of products in e-commerce, improving search results, and providing personalized product recommendations to customers.

## Approach

The project involves the following steps:

1. Importing necessary libraries and loading the Fashion-MNIST dataset.
2. Exploring and visualizing the data to understand the class distribution and nature of the images.
3. Preprocessing the data, including reshaping, normalization, and one-hot encoding of labels.
4. Developing three versions of the CNN model:
   - Basic version: A simple model with a few convolutional and dense layers.
   - Advanced version: A deeper model with more convolutional layers, batch normalization, and dropout.
   - Optimum version: A fine-tuned model with an optimized architecture and additional techniques like learning rate scheduling.
5. Training the models on the training data and evaluating them on the test data.
6. Comparing the performance of the three models and selecting the best model based on accuracy and robustness.
7. Visualizing the model predictions on a subset of test images.

## Results

The test accuracies achieved by the three models are as follows:

- Basic model: 0.9120
- Advanced model: 0.8986
- Optimum model: 0.9031

While the basic model achieved the highest accuracy, the optimum model demonstrated improvements over the advanced model and incorporated techniques like batch normalization and learning rate scheduling to enhance robustness and generalization.

## Next Steps

To further improve the models and gain additional insights, some potential next steps could be:

1. Hyperparameter tuning
2. Data augmentation
3. Transfer learning
4. Ensemble methods
5. Visualization and interpretation of learned features
6. Experimenting with different model architectures
